# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

This project is a simple Python script that converts user-inputted words into their NATO phonetic alphabet equivalents using the pandas library.

## Overview

The NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter reads a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet, prompts the user to enter a word, and then outputs the phonetic code for each letter in the word.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script that performs the conversion.
- `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv`: The CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet data.

   ```sh
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```

4. **Enter a word** when prompted to see its NATO phonetic alphabet representation.
